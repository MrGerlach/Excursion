In this project I'm creating a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” using toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.
The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so video and landscape imagery is used to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.

Update: I have now my own website with my portfolio. :) Link down below.
